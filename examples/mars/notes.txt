Notes:
- How will prioritization work with electricity? Ex: You obviously want to power habitat first


TODO:
- think about how to serialize and store runs of each model
- think about how nested heirarchy is going to work. Ex: habitat and what's inside that and then isolated, separate systems in greenhouse, but things that can flow inbetween ex: food.
- Concept of scopes
- Think about inventory of all objects. Ex: Calculate the mass of everything under consideration.
- Think about all the human time required
- Think about all subsystems could be extracted and studied in detail.
